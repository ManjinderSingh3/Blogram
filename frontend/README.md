- Frontend of Blogram is built in React using Tailwind CSS and Shadcn.
- Shadcn components are created at `frontend/src/shadcn-component/ui`

**Steps to install a Shadcn Component :**

1. Inside frontend module install the component specific dependnecy
2. Compy the code from Shadcn Website for a specific component which we want to use at this path `frontend/src/shadcn-component/ui`
3. For example if I want to reuse Shadcn button then we will create `frontend/src/shadcn-component/ui/button.tsx` file and paste the code inside that file.
4. Reuse that component throughout our code.
